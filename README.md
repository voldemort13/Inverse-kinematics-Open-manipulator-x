# Quick video to illustrate the implementation of the inverse kinematics

Utilizing our inverse kinematics script in conjunction with the /goal_joint_space_path service, we successfully created several basic drawings that do not demand a high level of precision. It's important to note that the robot's repeatability and precision are not optimal for tasks requiring meticulous accuracy.
